uvicorn[standard]==0.29.0            # Lightning-fast ASGI server to run FastAPI. '[standard]' includes performance extras.
gunicorn==22.0.0                    # Production-grade server to manage Uvicorn workers, ensuring stability.
python-dotenv==1.0.1                # Manages environment variables (like our API key) from a .env file.
httpx==0.27.0                       # A fully featured async-capable HTTP client, perfect for fetching documents from URLs in an async framework.
requests==2.31.0                    # Standard library for making HTTP requests; used as a simple fallback or for synchronous utility scripts.


# -- RAG Pipeline & AI Engine --
# The core components for document processing, retrieval, and generation.
